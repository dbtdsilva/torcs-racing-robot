1. Introduction
---------------
First a big welcome, I hope you will enjoy your ride:-)

This is an all in one package of TORCS. Be aware that some included
artwork has non free (in the GPL sense) licenses, you will find a "readme.txt"
in those directories. The rest is either licensed under the GPL or the Free
Art License. If you want to create cars or advanced tracks using the accc tool,
you will require stripe from http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~stripe.

Best regards

Bernhard


2. Non-Free content (in GPL sense)
----------------------------------
Here the list with the directories containing non free content, look at the
readme.txt for details:
- data/cars/models/pw-*
- data/cars/models/kc-*


3. Track editor
---------------
The track editor is not included in this distribution, you can get it from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/trackeditor.


4. Linux Installation from Source
---------------------------------
- Requires plib 1.8.5, FreeGLUT or GLUT, be aware to compile plib with -fPIC
  on AMD64 if you run a 64 bit version of Linux. Be aware that maybe just
  1.8.5 works.
- Untar the archive
- cd into the torcs-1.3.4 directory
- ./configure (use --help for showing the options, of interest might be
  --enable-debug and --disable-xrandr).
- make
- make install
- make datainstall
- start with "torcs"

Command line arguments:
* -l list the dynamically linked libraries
* -d run under gdb and print stack trace on exit, makes most sense when compile
     with --enable-debug
* -g run under Valgrind (requires a debug build for useful results)
* -e display the commands to issue when you want to run under gdb
* -s disable multitexturing, important for older graphics cards
* -m use X mouse cursor and do not hide it during races
* -r pathtoraceconfigfile, run race from command line only, for testing and AI
     training, see FAQ for details
* -k (keep) suppress calls to dlclose to keep modules loaded (for Valgrind runs,
     to avoid "??" in the call stack)


5. Windows Installation from Source (Release version)
-----------------------------------------------------
- hint: you can have a release and a debug build side by side, the release
  version goes to "runtime" and the debug to "runtimed".
- requires VS 6 (tested with sp6) or VS 2008 (tested with sp1)
- untar the archive into a path without whitespaces and special characters.
- cd into the torcs-1.3.4 directory
- run setup_win32.bat
- run setup_win32-data-from-CVS.bat
- select the TORCS workspace (TORCS.dsw for VS 6) or solution (TORCS.sln
  for VS 2008), select the w32-Release version.
- compile project (0 warnings)
- cd into the "runtime" directory.
- run "wtorcs.exe"

Command line arguments:
* -s disable multitexturing, important for older graphics cards
* -r pathtoraceconfigfile, run race from command line only, for testing and AI
     training, see FAQ for details 


6. Windows Installation from Source (Debug version)
---------------------------------------------------
- hint: you can have a debug and a release build side by side, the debug
  version goes to "runtimed" and the release to "runtime".
- requires VS 6 (tested with sp6) or VS 2008 (tested with sp1)
- untar the archive into a path without whitespaces and special characters.
- cd into the torcs-1.3.4 directory
- run setup_win32_debug.bat
- run setup_win32-data-from-CVS_debug.bat
- select the TORCS workspace (TORCS.dsw for VS 6) or solution (TORCS.sln
  for VS 2008), select the w32-Debug version
- compile project (0 warnings)
- cd into the "runtimed" directory.
- run "wtorcs.exe"

Command line arguments:
* -s disable multitexturing, important for older graphics cards
* -r pathtoraceconfigfile, run race from command line only, for testing and AI
     training, see FAQ for details 


7. Testing
----------
Please pick bugs below and retest them (you can find the original reports on
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3777&atid=103777, select "any" bugs to
see as well the closed ones). If you find problems which should be already
fixed or new ones please report them to the torcs-users mailing list.


8. Getting Help
---------------
During the game press F1. For more in depth information visit www.torcs.org,
you find there a lot of information, look at the documentation section on
the left, have as well a look into the list of howto's. If you are stuck
have a look into the FAQ to learn how and where to report a problem.


9. Running under Valgrind with Linux
------------------------------------
First you need to build a debug version of TORCS, make sure that the CFLAGS,
CPPFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environment variables are empty (usually they are). Then
run "make distclean", then configure script with the option --enable-debug
and all other options which you require, build and install as usual.

To find memory leaks run first (Valgrind must be in available in the path):
./torcs -g

You will find the logfile valgrind.log in the .torcs directory. If you have
"??" in the call stack, you can run TORCS with the -k option to avoid unloading
the modules:
./torcs -g -k

You should use -k just to investigate the "??" in the call stacks, because the
suppression of dlclose can hide problems related with module release and cause
problems because modules are just recycled but not reloaded.

Of course you can use this with the console (command line) mode as well, e.g.:
./torcs -g -r ~/.torcs/config/raceman/champ.xml
./torcs -g -k -r ~/.torcs/config/raceman/dtmrace.xml

Some additional notes:
- Valgrind (version 3.6.1) reports on systems with the ATI flgrx OpenGL driver (8.961)
  lots of leaks, according AMD Valgrind misinterprets memory blocks handed over to the
  kernel. When I wrote suppressions the flgrx driver hung the X Server up, conclusion:
  Give it a try (maybe another Valgrind/driver/kernel combination does/will do better),
  but if you run in the mentioned problems, just use the TORCS command line mode or
  install temporarily the Open Source ATI driver alternative, maybe this does do better
  (not tested, send me a report;-) )
- You can edit the "torcs" script and add "--leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes"
  to see what is still reachable at exit. This is useful to reduce the amount of cached
  xml file handles or hunt down missing releases of handles (they are not reported
  usually because they are reachable via the cache), beware, it is perfectly
  fine that the GUI and some handles are held permanent.


10. Changes
-----------


Changes since 1.3.4-test2
-------------------------
- Fixed illegal file open mode for VS 2008 runtime in trackgen (Bernhard).
- Refactored macros in trackgen to functions to be able to debug properly and to form the
  base for code/feature improvement (Bernhard).
- Run track/elevation/object.cpp of trackgen through astyle (Bernhard).
- Fixed error in trackgen which generated wrong faces inside of the pit building (Bernhard).
- Fixed error in trackgen which caused wrong normals on "pit caps" (the beginning/end
  of the building) if the pit is on the right side of the track (left was ok) (Bernhard).
- Fixed another error in trackgen to correct normals of the pit building (Bernhard).
- Track side fences are now generated by trackgen with two surfaces, such that lighting
  is correct (Bernhard).
- Changed trackgen to emit track and terrain as single sided surfaces (type 0x10 instead
  of 0x30), thatâ€™s why I had to fix all the above anomalies, the resulting back-face
  culling will help a bit with performance, proper rendering and z-buffer-racing (Bernhard).
- Fixed a crash bug in trackgen, related with terrain generation (Bernhard).
- Fixed a bug in texture handling in trackgen which caused texture misplacement and
  spawning of new groups (Bernhard).
- Trackgen does not anymore turn one sided objects into two sided ones (Bernhard).
- Fixed a bug in trackgen which caused a "hole" in the wall right after the pit under
  some special conditions (see e.g. g-track-1) (Bernhard).
- Fixed potential sscanf overflow in accc (Bernhard).
- Fixed a crash bug for accc on Linux, strdup(0) gives segfault (specified behaviour,
  but it worked on Windows), now building alpine-2 from ac files works as well on Linux
  (Bernhard).
- Removed unused 3D Studio Max loader code from accc (Bernhard).
- Fixed forza.ac texture names and broken objects, as preparation for fixing the
  shadow map (Bernhard).
- Trackgen can now generate a raceline model, which can then be combined with accc.
  Define the attstr name="raceline name" for your main track surfaces, then run e.g.
  trackgen -c road -n spring -r ("-r" for raceline), the review/edit the raceline file,
  then combine it with accc (Bernhard).
- Added some control parameters for raceline generation: attnum "raceline ext",
  "raceline int" and "raceline widthscale" (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to g-track-1 and michigan (Bernhard).
- Fixed various z-fighting (broken 3d model) on Brondehach track (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to ruudskogen (Bernhard).
- Adjusted lighting of corkscrew and brondehach (Bernhard).
- Did workflow related fixes on alpine-1, added raceline (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to ole-road-1, removed generated/outdated files (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to street-1 (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to spring (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to g-track-3, minor adjustments (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to g-track-2, minor adjustments (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to aalborg (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to e-track-4 (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to eroad (Bernhard).
- accc does not stop anymore on unknown verb with +shad (Bernhard).
- Added raceline to e-track-1 (Bernhard).
- Fixed potential null pointer dereferencing in accc (Bernhard).
- accc does not anymore truncate object names (could cause visual errors when
  combining multiple ac's to acc with long object names) (Bernhard).
- Fixed reordering of vertices in accc (Bernhard).
- Created new shadow map for forza, fixed missing shadow on cars (Bernhard).
- Adjusted forza for applying raceline, added raceline (Bernhard).
- Fixed holes and z-fighting in forza (Bernhard).
- Fixed graph hierarchy of brondehach and added raceline (Bernhard).
- Fixed surface types in brondehach (SURF 0x0 to 0x10, on 0X0 is transformed to 0x24
  by accc, so accc takes double sided surfaces and hence some z-fighting might happen
  then. Do not use flat shaded surfaces in TORCS, they are not supported) (Bernhard).
- Fixed frame rate dependency of flying cam (Bernhard).
- Changed texture orientation on the right side of the track in trackgen, beware, this has
  implications when regenerating existing tracks and "seamlessness" (e.g. g-track-1
  right side) (Bernhard).
- Fixed wrong state comparison in trackgen (could generate missing/broken/misplaced end
  caps on walls or curbs) (Bernhard).
- Fixed curbs with height 0 generating non planar surfaces in trackgen (Bernhard).
- Fixed ssggraph exiting on unknown verbs, now just a warning is emitted (Bernhard).
- Fixed more ulSetError string passing (Bernhard).
- Totally reworked e-track-3 track (Bernhard).
- Fixed wrong meshing in trackgen when border changes but side surface stays the same
  (Bernhard).
- Fixed bug regarding new "barrier hit rule" introduced in 1.3.4-test1 (when sound was
  switched off the priv.collision is not cleared, rules use now new priv.simcollision)
  (Bernhard).
- Totally reworked Wheel 1 track (Bernhard).
- Made simuv3 compile with gcc 4.6, does not matter because not part of build (Bernhard).
- Applied build fix for VS2010 suggested by Greg Duncan (Greg, Bernhard). 
  (http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog/Torquing-it-up-with-TORCS-The-Open-Racing-Car-Simulator)
- Added math.h includes in TORCS math headers for gcc 4.7 (Bernhard).
- Totally reworked Dirt-2 track (Bernhard).
- Added stripe.exe to the Windows installer with permission from Steven Skiena (Bernhard).
- Updated installer and Windows readme, added links to TORCS menu (online trackgen,
  youtube videos) (Bernhard).
- Added driver camera definition for car2/6/7-trb1 (Bernhard).


Changes since 1.3.4-test1
-------------------------
- Added search facility to TRB (Bernhard).
- Added hall of fame to TRB (Bernhard).
- Added command line option to run under Valgrind (-g) (Bernhard).
- Fixed tiny memory leak (module info was not released) (Bernhard).
- Fixed tiny memory leak (carname for results not released) (Bernhard).
- Adopted human.cpp to work with mem leak fixes (because of releasing
  memory now human.cpp would crash) (Bernhard).
- Fixed various small memory leaks in solid, just significant for 
  tracks with pit walls (Bernhard).
- Added command line option "-k" (keep) to suppress the execution of dlclose
  (useful for Valgrind runs to get symbol information instead of ??)
  (Bernhard).
- Fixed uninitialized variable in sound code (Bernhard).
- Fixed a bug in ModFreeInfoList, was not significant, because the function has
  never been used so far (Bernhard).
- Fixed small memory leaks in driverselect (Bernhard).
- Fixed small memory leak regarding directory.cpp (Bernhard).
- Fixed small memory leak in trackselect.cpp (Bernhard).
- Fixed many memory leaks in ssggraph (Bernhard).
- Fixed remaining tiny memory leaks regarding GfTime2Str (Bernhard).
- Disabled some xml caching to reduce memory footprint (Bernhard).
- Fixed more remaining leaked handles (Bernhard).


Changes since 1.3.3
-------------------
- Fixed wrong map rendering when window was scaled/not fully filled, reported by
  racer14 (Dan Nace) on the TRB (Dan, Bernhard).
- Fixed a label positioning problem when extra long strings are drawn into the
  same label in every timestep (Bernhard).
- Added rule: If the car touches a wall during a best lap, is not counted any more
  as fastest lap (to avoid using walls on alpine-2 etc. for qualifying times),
  inspired by this discussion: http://berniw.org/trb/forum/showthread.php?topicid=3272
  (Bernhard).
- Added rule: When cutting a corner during a best lap, the lap is not counted anymore as
  fastest lap. Cutting a corner is if the center of gravity is 0.7*carwidth outside of
  the main track segment in the turn inside, so on straights or on the turn outside you
  can still leave the track, pit entries and exits count as well as track (Bernhard).
- Restricted new rules to practice and qualifying (Bernhard).
- Timewarp goes now up to 128x real time, to keep the GUI responsive at least on
  every 2000th timestep a frame is rendered, it does not accumulate time anymore,
  so the slowdown commands are more responsive (Bernhard).
- Fixed ordering issue when two drivers have the same qualifying time, the first runner
  should now be always on top (Bernhard).
- Added more damage when scratching parallel to the wall (Bernhard).
- Applied OpenAL linkage patch provided by Paletta, see #3517253 (Paletta, Bernhard).
- Got rid of more gcc 4.6 warnings, just 2 left (Bernhard).


11. TODO/Notes
--------------


TODO for 1.3.5/6
--------------
- Training session with adjustable setup (trb)
- Setup change during the practice mode.
- Timed races (e.g. 24h).
- Remove invalid geometry from tracks 
- Review and eventually apply mac os x build
- Add raceline to wheel-2 and e-track-6.


TODO for 1.4.0
--------------
- Robot interface adoptions (maybe askfeatures, callonce, grid, postprocess, we will see...)
- More Rules.
- Apply SDL patch from Brian Gavin (rescheduled to 1.4.0 to get to to test
  seriously).
- Update OpenAL to 1.1, fix use of deprecated stuff.
- Car asignment for human players.
- Sound (alut depricated/scheduling for lots of cars)
- Make it possible for a robot module to carry any arbitrary number of
  drivers (instead of static 10).
- Pace car and trucks to remove wrecks (remove "virtual" crane).



TODO for Compliance
-------------------
155-DTM -> replace with car10-trb1
acura -> replace with car9-trb1
mc-larenf1 -> replace with car10-trb1
p406 -> replace with car1-trb4
rework buggy, baja bug



Later:
-------------------
- trackgen state consistency, e.g
  track4.cpp, line 218, borderHeight[side] does not carry over the previous state.
  Decide what to do (just assigning it changes the semantics of exisitng tracks if
  we are unlucky, either test/fix all or new track version).
- Decide about plib (not maintained anymore?) -> integration?
- Refactor trackgen (left/right -> half the code, maybe more)
- Mixed axis controller (under linux some analouge buttons generate a button and axis
  event, this is a problem for detection/calibration with the current workflow, e.g.
  ps3 controller buttons l2/r2)
- Ongoing for every release: rework free car models (several holes, no
  emmissive color of lod (model becomes dark at a certain distance), single
  sided, add cockpit, lods).
- Ongoing for every release: Improve visual quality of some existing tracks
  (e.g. e-track-2).
- Texture clamp to edge needs explicit setting in nvidia driver tab in windows,
  have a look into that (otherwise the border is not taken as color around the
  pit door, pits are quite dark around the logo).
- fix sound in split screen multiplayer. [in progress] (ask Christos).
- Ongoing: Replace some defines with "static const" to be able to see the
  symbol name when debugging.
- move berniw/bt spline code into math to share it.
- hunt down all glGet* crap during the simulation.
- (Problem when driver list changes during championship.)
- (add proper init/shutdown to every module which is not bound to anything else
  but the loading/init/shutdown/unloading process.)


TODO for 1.9.x (pre 2.0 series, no release)
--------------
- Design networking, how to embed it into TORCS?
- Networking prototype.
- Gaming modes suitable for online races.
- Cockpit inside view.
- Set up infrastructure for reading binary data files bit with and endianness independent.

TODO for 2.0.0
--------------
- Initial Networking.


TODO LATER
----------
- Add validation for the case no driver selected, do not exit to
  console.
- Networking (2.0).
- SMP simulaton core (for myself).
- Replays.
- Telemetry recorder/viewer.
- Phong specular highlights (optional env, cube or GLSL).
- Shadowmapped/Stenciled dynamic car shadows.
- so/dll with libtool, common code?
- 3d-grass.
- Dynamic sky.
- TRB integration.
- Fix/create new simu/switch to updated/new simu.
- Show just fitting resolutions for fullscreen/change for windowed mode.
- Separate components more clean (e.g. ssgInit should go back to
  ssggraph, etc.)
- Fix windows project such that it compiles in all locations (currently it
  fails if special characters are in the path).
- Avoid cameras cutting the landscape.
- Allow more mouse events /suggested by Frieder -> mouse wheel for gear
  switching).
- Start position marks on track (same technique like fake shadow, skids).
- Start procedures (pace car, etc).
- Better transparency for track objects.
- More driving aids, switch to AI and back.
- localization (e.g English, French, German, ...).
- Fix engine inertia/s of F1 cars, check/fix all other cars as well.
- Opponent sets for human players (e.g 20 Open Wheel cars, etc.)
- Free camera controlled with mouse and keys.
- Automate GL features verification (hopefully obsolete).


IDEAS FOR MUCH LATER
--------------------
- Weather.
- Dynamic day/night-time, car lights with projective texturing.
- Pit crew.
- Dynamic "intelligent" Objects (e.g. Helicopter)
- Solid/dynamic obstacles.
- Nicer trees etc, terrain LOD.
- Inside view.
- Animated driver.
- Dirt on cars, inside view.
- free terrain.
- Open track dynamically generated when driving.
- Random track generator.
- Separate pit path, Y segments, etc?
- TORCS as benchmark or screensaver?
- Switch to rigid body engine?
- Force feedback.
- (Compressed data files?)
- Story mode with message.
- Traffic simulator
